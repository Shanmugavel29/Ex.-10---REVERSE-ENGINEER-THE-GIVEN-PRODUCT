# Ex-10: REVERSE ENGINEER THE GIVEN PRODUCT

### AIM: 
 To reverse engineering the product and prototyping the same in 3D printer.
### REQUIREMENTS:
 ●	CURA 4.0 Software
 ●	 Autodesk Fusion 360
 ●	 System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.
### PROCEDURE:
 Step 1.:- Duplicate all the geometric features for the given object using vernier caliper, measuring tapes or any instruments provided<br>
 Step 2.:- Design the geometric features in 3D using auto desk fusion 360.<br>
 Step 3.:- Save the file and export as .stl<br>
 Step 4.:- Check all Electrical connections in the 3D printer.<br>
 Step 5.:- First we install the software related the 3D printer (idea maker, ultimaker etc.)In idea maker first open the software and click the open file option.<br>
 Step 6.:- Select the Pan option and select the extruder (left or right) for printing the design.<br>
 Step 7.:- Select the Move option for design print position in build tack plate and then after select the Rotate option for rotating the design easily printed and used low print material.<br>
 Step 8.:- select the Scale option for design scale according to build tack plate area and then<br>
 after click the start option and select printing option standard as shown in below figure.<br>
 Step 9.:- After completing the all setting then click the Slice option and export the file in gcode Format.<br>
 Step 10.:- After generate the gcode format then follow the these instruction <br>
    ●	Switch on the 3d printer.<br>
    ●	Place your Pen drive in USB.<br>
    ●	Clean your surface bed plate.<br>
    ●	Load your filament into the required extruder as per the requirement.<br>
    ●	Wait until the nozzle & bed plate comes into the required temperature.<br>
    ●	Close the doors of the 3d printer.<br>
    ●	Open the file from the USB storage and select the Print option.<br>
